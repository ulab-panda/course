## 🧠 Course Overview

Undergraduate research can be one of the most transformative experiences at Berkeley. However, many students feel they lack the knowledge, experience, or resources to get started.

ULAB is a **student-run research program** designed to help students from all backgrounds gain access to research opportunities.

This two-semester course:
- Pairs student groups with experienced undergraduate mentors.
- Completes a **year-long research project** from design to final presentation.
- Teaches often-overlooked research skills: Python, LaTeX, Git, plotting, statistics, and scientific communication.
- Connects students to a supportive community of faculty, grad students, and peers.
